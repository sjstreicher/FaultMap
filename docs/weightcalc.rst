Weight calculation
==================
Weight calculation is one of the core operations performed on time series data collected from process sensors in order to infer the relative importance of process elements.

The weight calculation methods are called from the ``weightcalc`` module in the ``faultmap`` package.

.. note::
   The following is the auto-generated documentation from the ``weightcalc`` module source:
