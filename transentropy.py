    Takes into account the time lag (number of samples between vectors of the
    same variable).

    In this application the prediction horizon (h) is set to equal
    to the time lag.

    The first vector in the data array should be the samples of the variable
    to be predicted (x) while the second vector should be sampled of the vector
    used to make the prediction (y).

    sub_samples is the amount of samples in the dataset used to calculate the
    transfer entropy between two vectors.
    The required number of samples is extracted from the end of the vector.
    If the vector is longer than the number of samples specified plus the
    desired time lag then the remained of the data will be discarded.
