Introduction
============

The LoopRank software package provides a set of tools for
prioritising base layer control loops from a maintenance
perspective on a plant-wide scale.

A mixture of data- and knowledge-based methods are employed.

Basic approach
--------------

The basic approach followed follows a two-step process:

* Defining the connectivity between all elements in the process.
* Using the connectivity to build a digraph which is then analysed
  according to various graph ranking algorithms.
